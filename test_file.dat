1) Lets continue with our first system call open()
2) whose purpose is to open file for reading or
3) writing or to create new file. You should open
4) it's man page if you haven't already done so
5) using man 2 open command and read trough basics
6) (2 is manual section number, use man man to read
7) more about integrated manual section numbers).
8) In the following example we also use read() and
9) write() system calls to copy from one file
10) descriptor to the other (both descriptors returned
11) by open() system call so it is wise to open
12) their man pages as well (man 2 read and man 2 write).
13) So here's the example code for program that
14) copies input file passed as first argument
15) into output file passed as second argument.
