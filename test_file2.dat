1) read()  attempts to read up to count bytes from
2) file descriptor fd into the buffer starting at buf.
3) On files that support seeking, the read operation
4) commences at the file offset, and the file offset
5) is incremented by the number of bytes read. If the
6) file offset is at or past the end of file, no
7) bytes  are  read, and read() returns zero.
8) If count is zero, read() may detect the errors
9) described below.  In the absence of any errors,
10) or if read() does not check for errors, a read()
11) with a count of 0 returns zero and has no other effects.
12) On success, the number of bytes read is returned (zero
13) indicates end of file), and the file position is advanced
14) by this number.  It is not  an error  if  this  number
15) is smaller than the number of bytes requested;
